# eco-logistics-optimizer

Creating a comprehensive Python program for an "eco-logistics-optimizer" is quite an extensive task. We will develop a simplified version of this tool, incorporating machine learning to minimize carbon footprint and logistics costs. We'll use Python libraries like Pandas, Scikit-learn, and NumPy. Error handling and comments will be included as needed.

This example will assume we're optimizing for transportation logistics, focusing on route selection and vehicle choice to reduce both costs and carbon emissions.

Here's a basic implementation:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
import logging

# Configure logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')

# Sample data for demonstration
# This should ideally be replaced with actual logistics and environmental impact data
# For a real project, load the data from a database, API, or file.
data = {
    'distance_km': [100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700],
    'weight_tonnes': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7],
    'cost_usd': [1000, 2000, 3000, 4000, 5000, 6000, 7000],
    'emissions_kg_co2': [50, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, 350]
}

# Convert data to DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Define features and target variables
features = df[['distance_km', 'weight_tonnes']]
targets = df['cost_usd']

# Split data into training and test sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(features, targets, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Standardize data
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_train_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test_scaled = scaler.transform(X_test)

# Initialize and train regression model
model = LinearRegression()
try:
    model.fit(X_train_scaled, y_train)
    logging.info("Linear Regression model trained successfully.")
except Exception as e:
    logging.error(f"Error training Linear Regression model: {e}")

# Predictions and evaluation
try:
    y_pred = model.predict(X_test_scaled)
    mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
    logging.info(f"Mean Squared Error: {mse}")
except Exception as e:
    logging.error(f"Error during prediction/evaluation: {e}")

# Clustering for route optimization
try:
    kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=3, random_state=42)
    df['cluster'] = kmeans.fit_predict(features)
    logging.info("KMeans clustering completed successfully.")
except Exception as e:
    logging.error(f"Error in KMeans clustering: {e}")

def optimize_route(distance_km, weight_tonnes):
    """
    Optimize route by predicting cost and suggesting logistics improvements.
    """
    feature_vector = scaler.transform([[distance_km, weight_tonnes]])
    try:
        predicted_cost = model.predict(feature_vector)
        cluster = kmeans.predict(feature_vector)
        logging.info(f"Predicted Cost: ${predicted_cost[0]:.2f} for Cluster {cluster[0]}")
        return predicted_cost[0], cluster[0]
    except Exception as e:
        logging.error(f"Error optimizing route: {e}")
        return None, None

# Example usage of the tool
if __name__ == '__main__':
    distance = 450  # Example distance in km
    weight = 3.5    # Example weight in tonnes
    try:
        cost, cluster = optimize_route(distance, weight)
        if cost is not None and cluster is not None:
            logging.info(f"Optimized Cost: ${cost:.2f} for Route Cluster: {cluster}")
    except Exception as e:
        logging.error(f"Error in optimization process: {e}")

```

### Key Components:
1. **Data Preparation**: We use sample data for the logistics problem. You should integrate real-world data from suitable databases or APIs.
2. **Model Selection**: I have chosen a simple linear regression model for cost prediction and KMeans clustering for route grouping. Depending on the complexity of the problem, other models may be more appropriate.
3. **Standardization**: StandardScaler is applied to standardize features for better model performance.
4. **Error Handling**: Try-except blocks are used to handle potential errors gracefully.
5. **Logging**: Provides information on the process flow and helps in debugging.

This is a foundational example and can be greatly expanded upon, especially with richer datasets, more sophisticated models, feature engineering, and integration into a larger system.
